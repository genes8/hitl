# Medigent — Cofounder deck (Jennifer) — Draft v1

**Language:** English
**Call:** Friday 17:00 (Belgrade)

## Slide 1 — Title / One-liner
**Medigent**
Explainable AI-powered pre-consultation for specialty clinics.
**We turn referral letters + patient answers into clinician-ready summaries with a full audit trail.**

## Slide 2 — The problem (US framing)
Specialists lose time and quality at the start of every visit:
- Intake is repetitive, incomplete, and varies by clinician
- Capacity is constrained (staffing + burnout) → long waits and lost revenue opportunity
- High-risk signals can be missed or discovered too late

## Slide 3 — Solution
A clinical intake agent that:
- Starts from the **referral letter (OCR/extraction)**
- Runs **personalized, guideline-driven questioning** (not a black-box chatbot)
- Produces a **structured clinician-ready summary** + risk flags + audit trail

## Slide 4 — Why we win (differentiation)
- **Explainable**: every question has a reason (“why asked” is traceable)
- **Clinician-designed flows** (sleep clinic MVP built with a sleep clinician)
- **Audit trail by default** (who/when/what)
- Structured outputs designed for downstream workflow / future EHR integration

## Slide 5 — Product / demo (3 screenshots)
Show 3 frames:
1) Admin: upload referral letter → OCR fields extracted
2) Patient: secure link → intake chat (branching questions)
3) Clinician/admin: structured summary → routed to assigned doctor

## Slide 6 — Wedge: Sleep clinics (then expand)
Start with a narrow wedge:
- Sleep medicine clinics: long histories, questionnaires, and clear intake structure
- Success metric: clinician time saved + better first-visit readiness
Then expand to other specialties with similar intake patterns.

## Slide 7 — Value / ROI (conservative but strong)
Primary KPI to validate in US pilots:
- **~20 minutes clinician time saved per patient** on baseline intake
Secondary:
- fewer back-and-forth messages / fewer unnecessary appointments
- faster triage / faster time-to-decision

## Slide 8 — Compliance posture (honest)
**Security-first, HIPAA-ready; formal compliance program in progress.**
- Designed for PHI: access controls, encryption, audit logs
- Next steps: BAAs with clinics + written HIPAA program + security reviews
- Later (enterprise): SOC 2 plan

## Slide 9 — Team
- **Enes Gogalić** — business/product/strategy
- **Andrija Petrović** — Head of AI development
- **Igor Grozdanovski** — Head of Development

## Slide 10 — The ask: Jennifer as US Cofounder
We want you to join as **US Cofounder (Clinical + GTM)** and own:
- US wedge + design partners (3–5 pilots)
- Clinical credibility + compliance path (BAAs + HIPAA program)
- Enterprise GTM + partnerships
- Fundraising narrative + warm intros (incl. Flare Capital)

**Next 7 days if yes:** align roles/vesting, 90-day plan, target clinic list + outreach.

## Appendix (optional)
- Competitive landscape (forms/intake tools vs LLM chatbots)
- Pilot plan: what we measure + how we run it
- Security checklist (what’s implemented vs planned)
